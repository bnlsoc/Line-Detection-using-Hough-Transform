# Line-Detection-using-Hough-Transform

### Hough Transform:

#### Description:

Hough transform is a line detection algorithm that uses voting based
mechanisms. It uses the polar m-c plane (ρ, θ plane) instead of the traditional cartesian (x-y)
plane. A line in cartesian coordinates (x-y plane) is represented as a point in the (ρ, θ) or (m,
c) plane In Hough transform,
